# ETF-Sector-Performance-Analysis-Utilizing-Machine-Learning-Models
These 5 files come from part of a UChicago Course, where I wrote them for labs regarding learning more about machine learning and its applications 
in the finance industry. It starts with basics, then moves more towards a difficult final part where I used many machine learning models to test out which one can
best predict the SPY curve based on data from other sectors. I learned many applications through this experience and how machine learning can be applied within 
the financial industry.
